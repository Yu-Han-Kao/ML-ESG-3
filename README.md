### Abstract

Our team participated in the multi-lingual Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) classification task, focusing on datasets in three languages: English, French, and Japanese. This study leverages Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), with a particular emphasis on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework, to analyze sentence and document structures across these varied linguistic datasets. The teamâ€™s experimentation with diverse PLM-based network designs facilitated a nuanced comparative analysis within this multi-lingual context. For each language-specific dataset, different BERT-based transformer models were trained and evaluated. Notably, in the experimental results, the RoBERTa-Base model emerged as the most effective in official evaluation, particularly in the English dataset, achieving a micro-F1 score of 58.82 %, thereby demonstrating superior performance in classifying ESG impact levels. This research highlights the adaptability and effectiveness of PLMs in tackling the complexities of multi-lingual ESG classification tasks, underscoring the exceptional performance of the Roberta Base model in processing English-language data.
